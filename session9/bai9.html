    <p class="text1">What have you been up to today? Did you have fun? Saw anything cool? C'mon, spill the beans! Encore loves stories! And the feelings people share... they're like one story after another!</p>
    <p class="text2">Here! You can have this chocolate, and I'll take your Star Flakes! And presto! Now you have yummy chocolate, and I have chocolate-flavored Star Flakes! How's that for a deal? Psst, It's a little trade secret I got from Aalto!</p>
    <p class="text3">Ooh… Watch out! The ghosts of food you didn't finish will crawl out of your tummy and give you bad dreams... Boo! Gotcha!</p>
    <p class="text4">Maybe one day, Encore will go everywhere in the world and be a hero too. Hehe, but first, what's for breakfast tomorrow?</p>
    <p class="text5">Cosmos and Cloudy are presents from Mommy. They’re my best buddies! Don't worry, they're nice Woolies, they tell me lots and lots of stories!</p>
    <p class="text6">Being happy is the bestest feeling, but it can't just be some pretend thing in a dream! Once upon a time, Encore was living in the happiest dream ever... but it had to stop, like all dreams do. Then when a dream is over, it's another brand new day ahead. Let's do our best!</p>
